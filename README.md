Airbnb NYC 2019 Analysis

This project analyzes Airbnb's 2019 NYC dataset to uncover trends in pricing, popularity, and revenue across neighborhoods and room types. I completed this as part of a course at Epsilon AI, where I developed skills in Python-based data analysis.

Project Overview

Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly, I cleaned the dataset, performed EDA, and visualized key findings. The analysis answers questions like:

How do prices differ by neighborhood?

What drives a listing’s popularity?

How does room type impact revenue?
